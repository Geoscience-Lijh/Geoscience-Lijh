## **Introduction**

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by [John Gruber in 2004][markdown], Markdown is now one of the worldâ€™s most popular markup languages.

All the content on my website is written in Markdown by [ghostwtriter][ghost], so here's a brief introduction to its basic usage. Of course, you can also find more details on the official website.

## **Heading**

Use a different number of "#" to adjust the level of the heading.
```
# Level 1 Heading
## Level 2 Heading
#### Level 4 Heading  
```
 
## **Separating**

Use three or more "-" , "*" or "_" to separate paragraphs.
```

***
___

```

## **Lists**

Use "*" , "+" or "-" to create unordered lists.
```
* Item one
+ Item two
- Item three
```
Use number and point to create ordered lists.
```
1. First item
2. Second item
3. third item
```

## **Code Blocks**

Use three ` at the beginning and end to create a code block.
```
This is a code block.
```

## **Mathematical Formulas**
Use $$ at the beginning and end to create a formula.

$$
E = mc^2
$$


## **Blockquotes**

use > to delimit block quotes
```
> This is a blockquotes.
>
>> This is nested block quote
```

## **LINKS**
Use [ ] and ( ) to link various website, such as [nature](https://www.nature.com/).
```
[nature](https://www.nature.com/)
```
You also can use reference links. This method allows you to manage links in a unified way.
```
[nature][id]

[id]: https://www.nature.com/
```
## **Images**
Use !, [] and ()can embed images.
```
![notebook](/images/notebook.jpg "an example image")
```
![notebook](/Geoscience-Lijh/images/notebook.jpg "an example image")

Or
```
![Hugo](https://gohugo.io/img/hugo-logo.png?w=200)
```

![Hugo logo](https://gohugo.io/img/hugo-logo.png?w=200)

You can also use the same syntax as with reference links.
```
![Hugo logo][Hugo] for a reference defined below.
